# Olutindo-app

This is a Cordova (Phonegap)-based Android application that uses [hood.ie](http://Hood.ie) for backend,
[Coconut](http://chrisekelley.github.io/coconut/) for most of its front-end form rendering, [backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) for MVC
and [backbone-hoodie](https://github.com/bbn/backbone-hoodie) to conect hood.ie and backbone.

This project is dependent upon [Olutindo](http://github.com/chrisekelley/olutindo) webapp. Remove the www directory and create
a symbolic link named www to the olutindo project.
