# Version plugin for Cordova 3.x #

Version allows you to get, display and use the version name and version code of your PhoneGap application.

This is for Cordova 3.x.  Use the version at https://github.com/gcatalfamo/Version for older versions of Cordova/Phonegap.

## Adding the Plugin to your project ##

$ cordova plugin add https://github.com/chrisekelley/Version.git

## Using the plugin ##

The plugin creates the object `window.plugins.version`.  To use, call one of the following, available methods:

	window.plugins.version.getVersionCode(
		function(version_code) {
			//do something with version_code
			console.log(version_code);

		},
		function(errorMessage) {
			//do something with errorMessage
			console.log(errorMessage);

		}
	);

	window.plugins.version.getVersionName(
		function(version_name) {
			//do something with version_name
			console.log(version_name);

		},
		function(errorMessage) {
			//do something with errorMessage
			console.log(errorMessage);

		}
	);
